# Linear Regression and Correlation

You will use Excel to determine the correlation of a data set with a pair of variables, graph its scatter plot, and determine the best-fitting line (linear regression).

## Preparation

In this lab, you will use a file containing data about the eruptions of the Old Faithful Geyser in Yellowstone National Park. Each row in the file represents an observed eruption of the Old Faithful Geyser. The *Eruptions* column represents the duration of the eruption in minutes, and the *Waiting* column represents the duration in minutes until the next eruption.

Download the data set called Lab 9 Old Faithful.xlsx from here [**https://github.com/bsosnovski/Intro-Stats-Excel-Lab-Manual/blob/main/Data_Sets/Lab-9-Old-Faithful.xlsx**](https://github.com/bsosnovski/Intro-Stats-Excel-Lab-Manual/blob/main/Data_Sets/Lab-9-Old-Faithful.xlsx). 

Open the Excel file *Lab 9 Old Faithful.xlsx* and follow the instructions below.

## Creating a Scatter Plot

1. Select the cells in the Columns *Eruptions* and *Waiting*.
2. Go to the `Insert` tab. Select `Scatter` in the `Charts` ribbon. Select the leftmost chart in the top row by clicking on it (Figure **\@ref(fig:scatter-plot)**).

```{r scatter-plot, echo=FALSE, fig.align = 'center', out.width='65%', fig.show='hold', fig.cap=' Scatter option in the Chart ribbon of the Insert tab.', fig.alt = 'A screenshot of the Scatter option in the Chart ribbon of the Insert tab.'}
knitr::include_graphics('scatter-plot.png')
```

The resulting plot is shown in Figure **\@ref(fig:resulting-scatter-plot)**.  The `Chart Design` tab shows that the leftmost diagram style is selected (Style 1).


```{r resulting-scatter-plot, echo=FALSE, fig.align = 'center', out.width='65%', fig.show='hold', fig.cap=' Scatter plot created.', fig.alt = 'The scatter plot created.'}
knitr::include_graphics('resulting-scatter-plot.png')
```

3. For the title, replace *Waiting* with *Old Faithful Data*.
4. Click `Add Chart Element > Axis Title > More Axis Title Options`. This will add an automatic *x*-axis title and *y*-axis title.
5. Click the *x*-axis title and replace it with *Duration of Eruptions (in Minutes)*.
6. Click the *y*-axis title and replace it with *Time Until the Next Eruption (in Minutes)*.
7. `RIGHT-click` on the horizontal axis and then select `Format Axis` to change the axis format in the plot. Set the *Minimum Bound* as 1. Adjusting the axis removes 
8. `RIGHT-click` on the vertical axis and then select `Format Axis` to change the axis format. Set the *Minimum Bound* as 30 and *Maximum Bound* as 100.

The adjusted box plot is shown in Figure **\@ref(fig:final-scatter-plot)**.

```{r final-scatter-plot, echo=FALSE, fig.align = 'center', out.width='65%', fig.show='hold', fig.cap=' Adjusted scatter plot.', fig.alt = 'Adjusted scatter plot.'}
knitr::include_graphics('final-scatter-plot.png')
```

## Calculating the Correlation Coefficient

1. Type the label *Correlation* in an empty cell in the worksheet. 
2. In the cell below *Correlation*, go to the `Formulas` tab and click the `Insert Function` ribbon.
3. In the dialog window, search for the `CORREL` function. Click `OK`.
4. For `Array 1`, select the cells in Column A of the data set.
5. For `Array 2`, select the cells in Column B of the data set.

```{r correl-funciton-mac, echo=FALSE, fig.align = 'center', out.width='40%', fig.show='hold', fig.cap='Dialog Box of the Correl function on MAC.', fig.alt = 'A screenshot of dialog box of the Correl function on MAC.'}
knitr::include_graphics('correl-funciton-mac.png')
```

```{r correl-funciton-pc, echo=FALSE, fig.align = 'center', out.width='40%', fig.show='hold', fig.cap='Dialog Box of the Correl function on PC.', fig.alt = 'A screenshot of dialog box of the Correl function on PC.'}
knitr::include_graphics('correl-funciton-mac.png')
```

Up to 4 decimal places, the correlation coefficient is 0.9008.

##Determining the Regression Line Equation

The *regression line equation* (or *least squares line*) is a straight line that best fits the data set. The equation of the line has the form $\hat{y}-bx+a$ where $b$ is the slope and $a$ is the *y*-intercept. The regression line explains the relationship between the independent variable (explanatory variable) and one or more dependent variables (response variable(s)).

The `LINEST(known_y's, known_x's, [const], [stats])` function calculates the slope and *y*-intercept of the regression line. The last two arguments in the formula are optional. 

1. Type the label *Regression Line* in an empty cell in the worksheet. 
2. Type the formula ``= LINEST(B1:B273, A1:A273)` in the cell below *Regression Line*.

**Note:** Alternatively, go to `Formulas > Insert Function` and search for the `LINEST` function.

The results output by the `LINEST` function is a slope equal to 10.7296414 and a y-intercept equal to 33.47439702.

## Graphing the Regression Line

1. `RIGHT-click` on any point plotted in the scatter plot (blue points).
2. Select `Add Trendline`.
3. Select the `Linear` trend. 
4. Check the box to `Display Equation on chart`. 

```{r trendline, echo=FALSE, fig.align = 'center', out.width='30%', fig.show='hold', fig.cap='Trendline options.', fig.alt = 'Trendline options.'}
knitr::include_graphics('trendline.png')
```


**Practice:**

For this exercise, you will switch the explanatory and response variables. That means changing the roles of *x* and *y* values for the same data set. Following the guidelines above, use Excel to:

a. Construct the scatter plot.
b. Calculate the correlation coefficient. 
c. Determine the regression lineâ€™s slope and y-intercept.
d. Draw the regression line in the scatter plot.
