The data set includes information such as the userâ€™s subscription type, device type, and the country in which they are located. Download the data set called Lab 6 Netflix Sample.xlsx from here: https://github.com/bsosnovski/Intro-Stats-Excel-Lab-Manual/blob/main/Data_Sets/Lab-6-Netflix-Sample.xlsx. 6.2 Pie Charts A pie chart (or a circle chart) is a circular statistical graphic that is divided into slices (or wedges) to illustrate numerical proportions. Open a new Excel worksheet and enter Earned Degree data, as shown below. Figure 6.1: Earned degree data. Select the cells A1:B6. Go to the Insert tab. Select the leftmost 2D Pie diagram in the top row in the Charts ribbon. Figure 6.2: Pie chart options in the Insert tab. If your graph does noy appear with a title and legend, do Steps 5 and 6 below. When you select the graph, the tab Chart Design appears in the menu bar (you must select the graph for this tool to appear). Choose Style 3 for your pie chart. Figure 6.3: Options in the Chart Design tab for pie charts. Note: Style 3 includes titles, legends, and labels in percent form. Check other styles to see the differences among them. Replace Number (in thousands) with the title Earned Degrees Conferred in 2000. Note: You can RIGHT-click on one of the data labels (e.g., on the percent of 45%) and then select Format Data Labels to change the format of the labels in your graph. Practice 1: Use Excel to build a pie chart for the data containing Device Type in the Lab 6 Netflix Sample.xlsx file. 6.3 Pareto Charts A Pareto chart is a bar graph with the bars arranged from the tallest bar to the shortest bar. Because of that, we need first to put the data in descending order. 6.3.1 Sorting Data Highlight the cells A1:B6 again. Copy (CTRL + C) the data, click on cell E1 (or any empty cells of the worksheet), and paste (CTRL + V) the data. Highlight the cells E1:F6 (or the cells that contain the copy of the data). Select Custom Sort in the Sort &amp; Filter ribbon in the Home tab in the menu bar. In the Sort dialog box that appears. Select the following options: Sort by -&gt; Number (in thousands) Sort on -&gt; Values Order -&gt; Largest to Smallest This will sort both highlighted columns concerning the highest frequencies. Check the box to the left on My list has headers. Click OK. Figure 6.4: Custom sort options.. 6.3.2 Building the Pareto Chart Select the cells E1:F6 (or the cells containing the copy of the data) that have been sorted. Go to Insert &gt; Column chart and choose the leftmost top type. Change the title of the graph to Earned Degrees conferred in 2000. With the graph selected, go to the Chart Design tab. To add axis titles, click Add Chart Element &gt; Axis Titles &gt; Primary Horizontal and then Add Chart Element &gt; Axis Titles &gt; Primary Vertical. Replace the horizontal axis title with the Type of Degree. Replace the vertical axis title with In Thousands.
