We can use the random number generator to simulate experiments such as tossing coins or rolling dice. 10.1 Simulating a Coin Tossing Experiment To simulate the experiment, assign to the outcome Head the digit 1 and to Tail the digit 2. You will draw a random sample of size 30 in Column A from the distributions of integers with a minimum value of 1 to a maximum value of 2. Write the label Coin Toss in cell A1. Type the formula = RANDBETWEEN(1,2) in cell A2 and press Enter/Return. Select cell A2 again, position the mouse pointer in the lower right corner of the selected cell until it becomes a + sign, and click-drag downward across until cell A31. Ensure that Excel randomizes all the values by going to the Formula tab in the menu bar and clicking the Calculate Now ribbon to apply the randomization. Column A should now have 30 random values. 10.2 Counting the Number of Heads and the Number of Tails Next, you will use Excel to count the 1’s and 2’s in column A. You will set up a table in Columns C and D to display the results. Type the label Outcome in Cell C1. Type the label Heads in Cell C2. Type the label Tails in Cell C3. Type the label Frequency in Cell D1. You will use the formula COUNTIF(data range, condition) to count the 1’s and 2’s as the formula’s conditions. Recall that we assigned the number 1 to the outcome Head and the number 2 to the Tail. Select cell D2, and enter the formula = COUNTIF(A2:A31,1). Next, select cell D3, and enter = COUNTIF(A2:A31,2). 10.3 Calculating the Empirical Probability Empirical Probability is based on experience or historical data to determine the likelihood of outcomes. It is calculated by determining the relative frequency. You will calculate the observed probabilities of the outcomes Heads and Tails you simulated. To calculate the relative frequency of an outcome, calculate the number of times the outcomes appear divided by the total number of all outcomes. Enter the label Rel Freq in cell E1. In cell E2, enter = D2/30. In cell E3, enter = D3/30. Select the cells E2 and E3 and go to the Home tab, and then adjust the results to have four (4) decimal places in the Number ribbon. Practice: Repeat this process to generate another simulation with 500 Coin Tosses in any empty cells of the Lab 9 worksheet.
