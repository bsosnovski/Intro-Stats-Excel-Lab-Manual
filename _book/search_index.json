The other random functions are RAND(), which returns an evenly distributed random real number greater than or equal to 0 and less than 1, and RANDARRAY(rows,columns,min,max,integer), which Returns an array of random numbers. For RANDARRAY, you can specify the number of rows and columns to fill, minimum and maximum values, and whether to return whole numbers or decimal values. We focus now on the RANDBETWEEN function. 2.1.1 Insert the function RANDBETWEEN on a PC To use RANDBETWEEN, select a cell in the active worksheet. Click in the formula tab and then click the Insert Function ribbon. Figure 2.1: Insert Function ribbon. Select the category All in the dialog window. Then select RANDBETWEEN and then fill in the bottom and top numbers. Returns a random integer number between the numbers you specify. Figure 2.2: The dialog Box of Insert Function on PC. 2.1.2 Insert the function RANDBETWEEN on a MAC Click on the Formula tab. Click the Insert Function ribbon. You will see on the right side of the Excel window that the Formula Builder appears. In the search box, start to type a keyword for the function you are looking for. Excel will list functions that match the criteria of the search you type. Then select the function you wish to insert in the worksheet. In this case, the RANDBETWEEN function. Adjust the parameters of the formula (top and bottom numbers) as needed. Figure 2.3: Dialog Box of Insert Function on MAC. Remark: Alternatively, you may simply type =RANDBETWEEN(bottom,top) in the formula bar, with numbers in place of bottom and top for the arguments of the formula. 2.2 Setting the Workbook to Manual Calculation The random number generators of Excel have the characteristic that whenever a command is entered anywhere in the active workbook, the random numbers change because they are recalculated. To prevent this from happening, change the recalculate mode from automatic to manual. 2.2.1 Manual Calculation on a PC Select File then Options. Click on the tab labeled Formulas. Select Manual Calculation for Workbook Calculation and uncheck the option Recalculate workbook before saving. Then press OK. Figure 2.4: Calculation options under Formulas in a PC. 2.2.2 Manual Calculation on a MAC Go to Excel Menu then select Preferences Figure 2.5: Preferences in the Excel Menu on a MAC. Under Formulas and Lists, click on Calculation Figure 2.6: Formulas and Lists in Preferences on a MAC. For Workbook Calculation, select Manual calculation and uncheck the option Recalculate workbook before saving. Figure 2.7: Calculation Options on a MAC. 2.3 Using the Recalculation Mode Even if the Calculation option is set for Manual, you can use a ribbon command or keyboard shortcut to force a recalculation when needed. You can still recalculate by pressing the keys Shift + F9 on the keyboard on a PC (For MAC, use keys Command + = ) or pressing the button Calculate Now in the Formulas Menu. Figure 2.8: Calculation ribbon. Practice 1: Suppose that there are 95 students enrolled in a section of the course Introductory Statistics. Draw a random sample of fifteen (15) of the students. To draw the sample, assign each of the students a distinct number between 1 and 95. To find the numbers of the 15 students to be included in the sample, do the following steps. Change the calculation mode to Manual (as described above). Type the label Sample in Cell A1 , Select Cell A2. Type =RANDBETWEEN(1,95) in the formula bar and press Enter. Position the mouse pointer in the lower right corner of Cell A2 until it becomes a + sign, and click-drag downward until you reach Cell A16. Release. Then press the key F9 (or Calculate Now button). Use one of the Sort buttons to sort the data to easily check for repetitions. If there are repetitions, press Shift + F9 (or Calculate Now) again and re-sort. Below, with the data sorted, we can verify that there are no repetitions 2.4 Creating Tables To make working with data easier, you can organize data in a table format on a worksheet. You are going to use Excel’s random number generator and tables to create a fictional grade book. Practice 2: Select the block of cells D1:H11. On the Home tab, in the Styles ribbon, click Format as Table, and then click the table style of your choice. Figure 2.9: Style ribbon. Select the My table has headers check box in the Format as Table dialog box. Figure 2.10: 32: Format As Table dialog box. Remark: When you select a table by clicking the mouse pointer, the Table Tools menu becomes available, and a Design tab is displayed. To get a good idea of what you can add to or change in your table, click the Design tab, then explore the groups and options provided on this tab. Replace the table headers. Instead of Columns1 through Column5, replace headers by typing in them the following: Name, Exam 1, Exam 2, Exam 3 and Final Exam. Under header Name, in cells 2-11, create 10 students’ names, writing last name, and first name. Now select the block of cells D2:D11. Click Home &gt; Sort &amp; Filter &gt; Select A to Z. The fictional names should then appear in alphabetical order. Select cell E2. Click on the Formula bar, type in =RANDBETWEEN(0,100). Position the mouse pointer in the lower right corner of cell E2 until it becomes a + sign and click-drag downward until you reach cell E11. Release (Note: Sometimes this feature is not needed within a formatted table). Repeat the process above for Column F using =RANDBETWEEN(40,98). Repeat the process above for Column G using =RANDBETWEEN(64,105). Repeat the process above for Column H using =RANDBETWEEN(37,100). If the list of numbers is not randomized, click the button Calculate Now. "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
