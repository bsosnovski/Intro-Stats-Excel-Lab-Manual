[["linear-regression-and-correlation.html", "Lab 9 Linear Regression and Correlation 9.1 Preparation 9.2 Creating a Scatter Plot 9.3 Calculating the Correlation Coefficient 9.4 Graphing the Regression Line", " Lab 9 Linear Regression and Correlation You will use Excel to determine the correlation of a data set with a pair of variables, graph its scatter plot, and determine the best-fitting line (linear regression). 9.1 Preparation In this lab, you will use a file containing data about the eruptions of the Old Faithful Geyser in Yellowstone National Park. Each row in the file represents an observed eruption of the Old Faithful Geyser. The Eruptions column represents the duration of the eruption in minutes, and the Waiting column represents the duration in minutes until the next eruption. Download the data set called Lab 9 Old Faithful.xlsx from here https://github.com/bsosnovski/Intro-Stats-Excel-Lab-Manual/blob/main/Data_Sets/Lab-9-Old-Faithful.xlsx. Open the Excel file Lab 9 Old Faithful.xlsx and follow the instructions below. 9.2 Creating a Scatter Plot Select the cells in the Columns Eruptions and Waiting. Go to the Insert tab. Select Scatter in the Charts ribbon. Select the leftmost chart in the top row by clicking on it (Figure 9.1). Figure 9.1: Scatter option in the Chart ribbon of the Insert tab. The resulting plot is shown in Figure 9.2. The Chart Design tab shows that the leftmost diagram style is selected (Style 1). Figure 9.2: Scatter plot created. For the title, replace Waiting with Old Faithful Data. Click Add Chart Element &gt; Axis Title &gt; More Axis Title Options. This will add an automatic x-axis title and y-axis title. Click the x-axis title and replace it with Duration of Eruptions (in Minutes). Click the y-axis title and replace it with Time Until the Next Eruption (in Minutes). RIGHT-click on the horizontal axis and then select Format Axis to change the axis format in the plot. Set the Minimum Bound as 1. Adjusting the axis removes RIGHT-click on the vertical axis and then select Format Axis to change the axis format. Set the Minimum Bound as 30 and Maximum Bound as 100. The adjusted box plot is shown in Figure 9.3. Figure 9.3: Adjusted scatter plot. 9.3 Calculating the Correlation Coefficient Type the label Correlation in an empty cell in the worksheet. In the cell below Correlation, go to the Formulas tab and click the Insert Function ribbon. In the dialog window, search for the CORREL function. Click OK. For Array 1, select the cells in Column A of the data set. For Array 2, select the cells in Column B of the data set. Figure 9.4: Dialog Box of the Correl function on MAC. Figure 9.5: Dialog Box of the Correl function on PC. Up to 4 decimal places, the correlation coefficient is 0.9008. ##Determining the Regression Line Equation The regression line equation (or least squares line) is a straight line that best fits the data set. The equation of the line has the form \\(\\hat{y}-bx+a\\) where \\(b\\) is the slope and \\(a\\) is the y-intercept. The regression line explains the relationship between the independent variable (explanatory variable) and one or more dependent variables (response variable(s)). The LINEST(known_y's, known_x's, [const], [stats]) function calculates the slope and y-intercept of the regression line. The last two arguments in the formula are optional. Type the label Regression Line in an empty cell in the worksheet. Type the formula `= LINEST(B1:B273, A1:A273) in the cell below Regression Line. Note: Alternatively, go to Formulas &gt; Insert Function and search for the LINEST function. The results output by the LINEST function is a slope equal to 10.7296414 and a y-intercept equal to 33.47439702. 9.4 Graphing the Regression Line RIGHT-click on any point plotted in the scatter plot (blue points). Select Add Trendline. Select the Linear trend. Check the box to Display Equation on chart. Figure 9.6: Trendline options. Practice: For this exercise, you will switch the explanatory and response variables. That means changing the roles of x and y values for the same data set. Following the guidelines above, use Excel to: Construct the scatter plot. Calculate the correlation coefficient. Determine the regression lineâ€™s slope and y-intercept. Draw the regression line in the scatter plot. "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
