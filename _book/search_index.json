A box and whisker plot is a graph showing the data distribution using the five-number-summary: minimum value, first quartile, median (second quartile), third quartile, and maximum value. This type of graph is also known as a box plot. The interquartile range (IQR) represents the spread of the middle half of the data and is calculated as the difference between the third and first quartiles. 8.1 Preparation In this lab, you will use a data set containing NY temperatures in September of 2013. Download the data set called Lab 8 NY Temp Sept2013.xlsx from here https://github.com/bsosnovski/Intro-Stats-Excel-Lab-Manual/blob/main/Data_Sets/Lab-8-NY-Temp-Sept2013.xlsx. Open the Excel file Lab 8 NY Temp Sept2013.xlsx and follow the instructions below. 8.2 Five-Number-Summary Using Excel, you will compute the five-number summary, generate a box plot, and compute the interquartile range (IQR) for Lab 8 NY temperatures in the September 2013 workbook. Use Excel to compute the following in an empty part of the worksheet. Choose a cell and type Min, and in the cell next to it, enter = MIN(B3:B32) to find the minimum value of the data set. Below Min, type Q1, and in the cell next to it, enter = QUARTILE(B3:B32,1) to find the first quartile. Below Q1, type Q2, and in the cell next to it, enter = QUARTILE(B3:B32,2) to find the second quartile. Below Q2, type Q3, and in the cell next to it, enter = QUARTILE(B3:B32,3) to find the third quartile. 5, Below Q3, type Max, and in the cell next to it, enter = Max(B3:B32) to find the maximum value of the data set. Below Max, type Median, and enter = MEDIAN(B3:B32) next to it to compute the median. Be sure that your five-number summary is organized to display the results. For example: Table 8.1: Example of a five-number-summary Min 18.00 Q1 24.50 Q2 38.00 Q3 44.25 Max 58.00 Median 38.00 Note: The five-number summary for the NY Temperatures will differ from those shown in Table 1. 8.3 The Interquartile Range Using Excel compute the IQR of the data set. Recall that the formula for IQR is IQR = Q3 - Q1. Use an Excel formula to calculate the IQR. Your formula must use cell addresses in the calculation. Place your formula in empty cells below your five-number summary. 8.4 Box Plot Select the cells with the temperature values in Column B. Go to the Insert tab. Select Box and Whisker in the Charts ribbon (Figure 8.1). Figure 8.1: Box and Whisker option in the Chart ribbon of the Insert tab. The resulting plot is shown in Figure 8.2. Figure 8.2: Box and Whisker created. Replace Chart Title with NY Temperatures in September 2013. RIGHT-click on the vertical axis and then select Format Axis to change the axis format in the graph. Set the Minimum Bound as 45. Adjusting the axis removes the unnecessary space in the chart. Figure 8.3: Format Axis options. Use the Chart Design to customize the look of your chart. Select the graph, and the tab Chart Design appears in the menu. Click on the Chart Design tab. Click Add Chart Element &gt; Data Labels &gt; Right. Click Add Chart Element &gt; Axes. Uncheck the option Primary Horizontal. The adjusted box plot is shown in Figure 8.4. Figure 8.4: Adjusted box plot. Practice: Use Excel to generate the five-number-summary, IQR, and box plot for the financial data you collected for Lab 5 Time Series and Measures of Central Tendency.
