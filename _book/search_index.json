A measure of central tendency shows where the center or middle of the data set is located. A measure of variation shows the spread among data values. Throughout these instructions, Select means to left-click with the mouse/pad. 4.1 Preparation In this lab, you will use a data set that contains three samples. You will compute descriptive statistics in different ways. Download the data set called Lab 4 Samples.xlsx from here: https://github.com/bsosnovski/Intro-Stats-Excel-Lab-Manual/blob/main/Data_Sets/Lab-4-Samples.xlsx Sample 1 contains 100 data values. Sample 2 contains 120 data values. Sample 3 contains 95 data values. Open the Excel file you downloaded and follow the instructions below. 4.2 Using the Descriptive Statistics in Excel to Obtain the Measures Sample 1 Go to Data &gt; Data Analysis. Select Descriptive Statistics and click OK. Note: If Data Analysis does not appear in the Data menu, refer to the instructions in Lab 1 Getting Started with Excel how to make it available. Figure 4.1: Data Analysis dialog window. The Descriptive Statistics window should appear. Complete the Descriptive Statistics window with the information needed from the data in Sample 1. The Input Range for Sample 1 has cell address $A$2:$A$101 (not including the label). If you include the label cell in the address, the address is $A$1:$A$101 (the first cell address is different). You may want to fill in the input range by manually typing the address or by selecting the cells. If the data values are stacked in a column, then check the options Grouped by Columns. If they were entered into Rows instead, then you would select the rows option. After you filled in the input range field, check or uncheck the box Labels in the first row according to what is in the input range. Check the option Output Range and select a cell in a blank area of your worksheet. 8.Check the option Summary statistics. Figure 4.2: Descriptive Statistics dialog window. These options give you the statistics of Sample 1 such as mean, median, standard deviation, and others. Figure 4.3: The resulting summary statistics for Sample 1. 4.2.1 Practice 1 Now you will do the same work above (Steps 1-8) for Samples 2 and 3. Note: In the instructions above, you must adjust the cell addresses for Samples 2 and 3. 4.3 Using Excel’s Functions to Obtain the Measures Sample 1 Next to the column containing Sample 1 (between Sample 1 and Sample 2), click on an empty cell of the worksheet and type Mean. Click on the cell right next to it and type =AVERAGE(A2:A101). Note: You can also use the Excel function Average by clicking: Formulas &gt; Insert Function. Below the cell Mean, type the word Median. Click on the cell right next to it and type =MEDIAN(A2:A101). Below the cell Median, type Stand. Dev. Click on the cell right next to it and type =STDEV.S(A2:A101) (sample standard deviation). Note: The STDEV.P calculates the standard deviation based on the entire population given as arguments and the STDEV.S estimates the standard deviation base on a sample. Excel does not have a Range function, so below the standard deviation type the word Range and next to it compute the range by using the formula Range = Max – Min. Below the cell Range, type Mode(s). You will investigate the many modes in the data set and what they are. For that, you will use the function MODE.MULT(). This function returns a vertical array of the most frequently occurring, that is, the mode(s) of the data set. Starting with the cell next to the word Mode(s), select a vertical range of cells (a block of any number of vertical cells). While the block of cells is selected, type the function MODE.MULT(A2:A101) into the Formula bar. Press the keys Control + Shift + Enter (For MAC, use the keys Command + Shift + Enter). Note: Be careful! If you only press Enter or use the function MODE, Excel will only display one value for the mode even if there are multiple modes. Note: If there is no mode, #N/A will appear as a result. If there is only one mode, MODE.MULT returns the same value repeatedly. Figure 4.4: The results from the Excel functions used above.. 4.3.1 Practice 2 Now you will do the same work above (Steps 1-10) for Samples 2 and 3. Note: In the instructions above, you must adjust the cell addresses for Samples 2 and 3. Compare the results obtained in Section 4.2 with the results obtained in Section 4.3. The results should be the same. "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
