Statistics is present in many ways in our lives. Statistical methodology can be found in surveys, sampling, clinical trials, studies of biomedical treatments, digital marketing, finance, etc. In recent years, Statistics has undergone changes in its techniques and approaches because of the need to analyze exceptionally large and complex data sets that arise all around us but cannot be done by hand. Since we have more powerful computers available to us at the present time, we can employ them to analyze these large data sets. Thus, it is even more important to learn how to use computer applications for statistical analysis, enhancing technology skills effectively for academic research and lifelong learning.

\hypertarget{about-this-manual}{%
\section*{About this Manual}\label{about-this-manual}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{About this Manual}

This manual has been written as a companion text for an introductory statistics course using Excel software. Topics include descriptive statistics; probability; binomial and normal distributions; sampling; confidence intervals and tests of hypotheses.

This text is to be used as a tutorial on how to use Excel to learn some fundamentals concepts covered in a typical Introduction to Statistics course and as a tool to advance technology skills effectively for academic research and lifelong learning. It is to be used alongside lectures and/or textbooks in such a course. This text is not a comprehensive introduction to Excel or Statistics.

The mathematical equations required for statistical concepts such as the mean and the standard deviation have not been provided as these are easily performed with functions in Excel.

\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Introduction}

Microsoft Excel® is a spreadsheet software for business applications available in the Microsoft Office® package. Excel enables users to format, organize, and calculate data with formulas and functions.

This basic Excel lab manual provides students and the novice with the skills needed to use Excel's built-in statistical functions and how to produce some useful graphs. It also prepares them for more advanced skills using the Excel software.

Although Excel is a powerful tool for executing many personal and professional activities, it is not a statistical data analysis package. It was never designed to be one, but it has the \emph{Data Analysis ToolPak}, an extra feature extending Excel's standard capabilities. Data Analysis ToolPak enables users to perform various statistical analyses in Excel. In many cases, macros (automated actions that can be used repeatedly to perform a task or tasks) can be created to produce special graphs, such as box-and-whisker plots.
However, this manual only shows how to use some of the existing built-in features and the Data Analysis ToolPak.

The Analysis ToolPak is part of Excel and can be added to the basic Excel program as an option on the program's list of Add-ins. The details for getting started with the Analysis ToolPak are presented in Chapter \textbf{\ref{start}} of this manual. No additional software is required to use the Excel functions described.

Excel runs slightly differently on MACs and PCs. Whenever there is a difference between Excel for Mac and PC on performing a task, each system's instructions in this lab will be provided separately. Otherwise, the same set of instructions is applied to both systems.

\hypertarget{start}{%
\chapter{Getting Started with Excel}\label{start}}

City University of New York (CUNY) Students can access Excel via Microsoft 365. On most campuses, students can also remotely access a computer lab at their specific campus.

If obtaining Excel via Microsoft 365, download the software to your machine. Do not run Excel from the cloud. Running it from the cloud does not give students access to the \emph{Analysis ToolPak} (see Section \ref{toolpak}).

\hypertarget{the-excel-window}{%
\section{The Excel Window}\label{the-excel-window}}

Note that in the Excel Windows shown in Figures \ref{fig:window-pc} and \ref{fig:window-mac}, the title bar shows \texttt{Book1} as a temporary name for the file. When opening a new Excel file (also called a Workbook, see Section \ref{workbook}), it has a suggested temporary name, \texttt{Book1}, \texttt{Book2}, etc, depending on how many new files are open before saving them. When saying it for the first, Excel will prompt the user to rename it.

\hypertarget{the-excel-window-on-a-pc}{%

\hypertarget{saving-excel-files}{%
\section{Saving Excel Files}\label{saving-excel-files}}

On the main menu, click \texttt{File\ \textgreater{}\ Save\ As} when saving for the first time. A dialog box will appear, similar to the one in figure \ref{fig:saving-dialog-box}. Fill in the file name, select the directory of your choice where the file will be saved on your machine, and the file type, for example, file with extensions \texttt{.xlsx} or \texttt{.xls}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.45\linewidth]{saving-pc2}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{saving-mac2} 

}

\caption{Dialog box when saving a workbook on a MAC.}\label{fig:saving-dialog-box-mac}
\end{figure}

After using the \texttt{Save\ As} feature, you can use the \texttt{Save} command to overwrite your previously saved file with the file in its current state. After saving the Excel file for the first time, you can save the updates during your working session using the save button on the title toolbar.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.85\linewidth]{saving-options} 

}

\caption{Saving options.}\label{fig:saving-options}
\end{figure}

It is essential to save your Excel files whenever you start a new project or periodically when you make changes to an existing file. Saving early and often can prevent your work from being lost. You'll also need to pay close attention to where you save the workbook so it will be easy to find later.

You can also turn on the \emph{AutoSave} feature to save your data automatically while working on Excel. The following are the steps to turn on Auto-save.

\hypertarget{autosave-on-a-pc}{%
\subsection{AutoSave on a PC}\label{autosave-on-a-pc}}

\begin{enumerate}

\end{figure}

\textbf{Note:} AutoSave in Excel is a special feature for Microsoft 365 subscription accounts. When you save your Excel spreadsheet online on OneDrive or SharePoint, Excel activates the AutoSave feature. AutoSave in Excel saves your progress every few seconds so that all changes appear online if someone else is working on the same file.

\hypertarget{opening-an-excel-file}{%
\section{Opening an Excel File}\label{opening-an-excel-file}}

To open an Excel file, go to the main menu and click \texttt{File\ \textgreater{}\ Open}. Select the directory containing the file, then select the file you want to open.

\hypertarget{toolpak}{%

\end{figure}

\hypertarget{workbook}{%
\section{The Excel Workbook}\label{workbook}}

The workbook is an Excel file that consists of one or more worksheets. The tabs near the bottom of the screen show that we are working with Sheet 1 (check Figures \ref{fig:window-pc} and \ref{fig:window-mac}) . To change worksheets, click on the corresponding worksheet tab. Alternatively, you can right-click (or \texttt{Control\ +\ click}) the arrows just to the left of the worksheet tabs to get a list of all the worksheets in the projects and select a worksheet.

\hypertarget{the-cells-in-the-worksheet}{%
\subsection{The Cells in the Worksheet}\label{the-cells-in-the-worksheet}}

When you look at a worksheet, you should see horizontal and vertical grid lines. Grid lines are light grey lines that appear around cells on Microsoft Excel worksheets. If they are missing, you will need to activate that feature. To do so, see lines:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Select the \texttt{View} tab.
\item
  Click the \texttt{Show} group on the tab.
\item
  Be sure that the \texttt{Gridlines} option is checked or selected.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{gridlines-mac} 

}

\caption{Gridlines option in the View tab.}\label{fig:gridlines-mac}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{cell-addresses}{%
\subsection{Cell Addresses}\label{cell-addresses}}

Intersecting rows and columns form the cells. A cell's address consists of a column letter followed by a row number. For example, address B3 designates the cell in Column B, Row 3. When Cell B3 is highlighted, it is the active cell, which means we can enter text or numbers into Cell B3.

\hypertarget{selecting-cells}{%
\subsection{Selecting Cells}\label{selecting-cells}}

To select a cell, position the cursor in the cell and click the left mouse button (or click on your computer's trackpad). Sometimes you will want to select several cells simultaneously to format them (as described next).

To select a rectangular block of cells, position the cursor in a corner cell, hold down the left mouse button, drag the cursor to the cell in the opposite corner of the block, and release the button.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{cell-selection} 

}

\caption{A block of cells selected in the worksheet.}\label{fig:cell-sellection}
\end{figure}

To select an entire column, click on the letter above the column to be selected; to select an entire row, click on the number to its left.

To select every cell in the worksheet, click on the blank gray rectangle in the upper left corner of the worksheet (above row header 1 and left of column header A).

You can also select a block of cells by typing the two corner cells into the active cell address window. For example, typing B3:E4 and pressing \texttt{Enter} would select the rectangular block of cells from B3 to the opposite corner E4.

\hypertarget{formatting-cell-contents}{%
\subsection{Formatting Cell Contents}\label{formatting-cell-contents}}

In Excel, you may place text or numbers in a cell. As in other Windows applications, you can format the text or numbers by using the formatting toolbar buttons for bold (B), italics (I), underline (U), etc. Other options include left, right, and centered alignment within a cell.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{text-formatting} 

}

\caption{Text Formatting ribbon in the Home tab.}\label{fig:text-formatting}
\end{figure}

Numbers can be formatted to represent dollar amounts (\$) or percent form (\%) and can be shown with commas in large numbers (,). The number of decimal places to which numbers are carried is also adjustable. All these options appear on the formatting menu bar. Other options are accessible by right-clicking on a cell and selecting Format Cells.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{number-formatting} 

}

\caption{Number Formatting ribbon in the Home tab.}\label{fig:number-formatting}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{changing-cell-width}{%
\subsection{Changing Cell Width}\label{changing-cell-width}}

Column widths and row heights can be adjusted by placing the cursor between two columns' letters or row numbers. Hold the left mouse button down when the cursor changes appearance, move the column or row boundary, and release.
All these instructions may seem a little mysterious, but once you try them, you will find that they are fairly easy to remember.

\hypertarget{entering-data}{%
\section{Entering Data}\label{entering-data}}

In Excel, we enter data and labels in the cells. It is common to select a column for the data and place a label as the first entry of the column.

\textbf{Practice 1:}

The number of ads and the time devoted to ads were recorded for every twenty hours of prime-time viewing. Enter the data as shown in Figure \ref{fig:entering-data} in your Excel workbook.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.25\linewidth]{entering_data} 

}

\caption{Excel worksheet with data.}\label{fig:entering-data}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{entering-and-correcting-data}{%
\subsection{Entering and Correcting Data}\label{entering-and-correcting-data}}

To select a cell for content entry, move the mouse pointer to the cell and click. Then type the label or data and press Enter. Excel automatically moves to select the next cell in the same column. If you want to enter information in a different cell, click on it.

Errors are easily fixed. If you notice a mistake before you press Enter, back-arrow to the mistake and correct it. If you see the error after you have pressed Enter, select the affected cell, and then click on the formula bar to add a typing cursor to the cell contents displayed. Use standard keyboard editing techniques to make corrections, then press \texttt{Enter}.

If you want to erase the contents of a cell or range of cells but keep the formatting:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Select the cells and click \texttt{Home}
\item
  Click the arrow next to \texttt{Clear}
\item
  Select \texttt{Clear\ Content} (or press \texttt{Delete})
\end{enumerate}

The \texttt{Clear\ \textgreater{}\ Clear\ Formats} option keeps the content but clears the format. The \texttt{Clear\ \textgreater{}\ Clear\ All} option removes both content and format.

\textbf{Note:} \texttt{Clear\ \textgreater{}\ Formats} is handy for changing percent data back into decimal format.

\hypertarget{arithmetic-options-on-the-standard-toolbar}{%
\section{Arithmetic Options on the Standard Toolbar}\label{arithmetic-options-on-the-standard-toolbar}}

\hypertarget{summing-data-in-a-column}{%
\subsection{Summing Data in a Column}\label{summing-data-in-a-column}}

On the \texttt{Formula} Menu, the button you see in Figure \ref{fig:autosum} automatically sums the values in the selected cells.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.1\linewidth]{autosum} 

}

\caption{Autosum button.}\label{fig:autosum}
\end{figure}

When we sum the contents of an entire column, Excel places the sum under the selected cells. It is a good idea to type the label \emph{Total} next to the cell where the total appears.

\textbf{Practice 2:}

For the data you entered in your worksheet (see Practice 1), select cells in Column A containing numerical values (a2:a21). Press the button \texttt{AutoSum}, then type the word \emph{Total} in the corresponding row of Column C. We see that the sum of Column A is 419.

\hypertarget{sorting-data}{%
\subsection{Sorting Data}\label{sorting-data}}

The \texttt{Sort} and \texttt{Filter} ribbon on the \texttt{Home} tab shown in Figure \ref{fig:sorting} can be used to sort the data in ascending or descending depending on the selection from the sub-menu.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.3\linewidth]{sorting} 

}

\caption{Sort and Filter buttons.}\label{fig:sorting}
\end{figure}

To sort just one column, highlight that column and press the button and select the sort order. To sort two or more columns by ascending or descending order of the data in the first column, highlight all the columns and click the appropriate button. In general, we will sort one column of data.

\textbf{Practice 3:}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Sort the data in the first column in ascending order.
\item
  Now undo the ordering you just did to your data.
  -- If you have not made any other changes since you did the sort, you can use \texttt{Undo} function of Excel from the \texttt{Title\ Bar} from the main menu. The data will appear in their original order.
  -- Another option to undo actions in Excel, use the keys \texttt{Ctrl-Z} on a PC keyboard or \texttt{Command-Z} on a MAC.
\end{enumerate}

After step 2 above, your data set should be in the original form.

\hypertarget{copying-cells}{%
\subsection{Copying Cells}\label{copying-cells}}

To copy one cell or a block of cells to another location on the worksheet:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Select the cells you wish to copy.
\item
  From the \texttt{Home\ Menu}, select \texttt{Copy} (the shortcut with the keyboard for this process is \texttt{Ctrl-C} or \texttt{Command\ -C}). Notice that the range of cells being copied now has a blinking border around it.
\item
  Select the upper-left cell of the block that will receive the copy.
\item
  Press Enter. When you press Enter, the copy process is complete, and the blinking border around the original cells disappears.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Note:} Even if you use the command \texttt{Paste} or the shortcut \texttt{Ctrl-V} or \texttt{Command-V} to paste, you must still press Enter to remove the blinking border around the original cells. To copy one cell or a range of cells to another worksheet or workbook, follow steps (1) and (2) above. For step
(3), be sure you are in the destination worksheet or workbook and that the worksheet or workbook is activated. Then proceed to step (4).

\textbf{Practice 4:}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Copy the contents of columns A and B and paste them into columns F and G. Then sort the data in Column F in descending order
\item
  Also, copy the contents of columns A and B and paste them into columns J and K. Then custom sort the data in Columns J and K by the values in Column J in ascending order
\end{enumerate}

After step 2 above, your worksheet should have 3 sets of data where the 2 rightmost ones have modifications in the ordering of the columns according to the instructions in the practice above.

\hypertarget{using-formulas}{%
\section{Using Formulas}\label{using-formulas}}

A formula is an expression that generates a numerical value in a cell (like a calculator), usually based on values in other cells.
Formulas usually involve standard arithmetic operations. Excel uses + for addition, \texttt{-} (hyphen) for subtraction, \texttt{*} for multiplication, \texttt{/} for division, and \texttt{\^{}} (carat) for exponentiation (raising to a power). For instance, if we want to divide the contents of Cell A2 by the contents of Cell B2 and place the results in Cell C2, we do the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Make Cell C2 the active cell.
\item
  Click in the formula bar and type \texttt{=A2/B2}.
\item
  Press \texttt{Enter}.
\end{enumerate}

Cell C2 will be the quotient of the values in Cells A2 and B2.
If for a whole series of rows, we wanted to divide the entry in Column A by the entry in Column B and put the results in Column C, we could repeat the above process over and over. However, the typing would be tedious. We can accomplish the same thing more easily by replicating the formula in one cell in other cells.

\textbf{Practice 5:}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Enter \texttt{=A2/B2} in Cell C2 as described above.

  Release the mouse button (you may need to press \texttt{Enter} right after, depending on how your Excel program is configured). The cell entries in Column C should equal the quotients of the same-row entries in Columns A and B.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{adjustment-to-formulas}{%
\section{Adjustment to Formulas}\label{adjustment-to-formulas}}

Now, if you click on one of the lower cells in Column C, you will see that the row number in the cell addresses is not 2, but rather the number of the new cell's row. Generally, when a formula is copied from one cell to another, the cell addresses in the formula are automatically adjusted. For example, if the formula \texttt{=D3+C7} is copied to a new cell, three columns right and two rows up from the old one, the pasted formula comes out as \texttt{=G1+F5}. (Three columns right from D is G, two rows up from 3 is 1, and so on.)

Sometimes you will want to prevent the automatic address adjustment. To do this, put a dollar sign before any row or column number you want to keep from changing. When the formula \texttt{=D\$3+\$C7} is copied to a new cell, three columns right and two rows up from the old one, the pasted formula comes out as \texttt{=G\$3+\$C5}. We will call an address with two \texttt{\$} signs in an absolute address because it always refers to the same cell (\texttt{\$} fix the addresses in a formula), no matter where the formula is copied/pasted. For a cell with only one \texttt{\$} sign in it or none, we will call a relative address because the cell referred to can change as the formula is pasted from one location to another.

\section{Random Samples}\label{random-samples}}

Excel has few random number generators. The other random functions are \texttt{RAND()}, which returns an evenly distributed random real number greater than or equal to 0 and less than 1, and \texttt{RANDARRAY(rows,columns,min,max,integer)}, which Returns an array of random numbers. For RANDARRAY, you can specify the number of rows and columns to fill, minimum and maximum values, and whether to return whole numbers or decimal values.

We focus now on the \texttt{RANDBETWEEN} function.

\hypertarget{insert-the-function-randbetween-on-a-pc}{%

\item
  The \emph{Descriptive Statistics} window should appear. Complete the Descriptive Statistics window with the information needed from the data in Sample 1.
\item
  The \texttt{Input\ Range} for Sample 1 has cell address \texttt{\$A\$2:\$A\$101} (not including the label). If you include the label cell in the address, the address is \texttt{\$A\$1:\$A\$101} (the first cell address is different). You may want to fill in the input range by manually typing the address or by selecting the cells.
\item
  If the data values are stacked in a column, then check the options \texttt{Grouped\ by\ Columns}. If they were entered into \emph{Rows} instead, then you would select the rows option.
\item
  After you filled in the input range field, check or uncheck the box \texttt{Labels\ in\ the\ first\ row} according to what is in the input range.
\item
  Check the option \texttt{Output\ Range} and select a cell in a blank area of your worksheet.

\textbf{Practice 1:}

Now you will do the same work above (Steps 1-8) for \emph{Samples 2} and \emph{3}.

\textbf{Note:} In the instructions above, you must adjust the cell addresses for Samples 2 and 3.

\hypertarget{excel-functions}{%
\section{Using Excel's Functions to Obtain the Measures}\label{excel-functions}}

\textbf{\emph{Sample 1}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Next to the column containing Sample 1 (between Sample 1 and Sample 2), click on an empty cell of the worksheet and type \emph{Mean}.
\item
  Click on the cell right next to it and type \texttt{=AVERAGE(A2:A101)}.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Note:} You can also use the Excel function Average by clicking: \texttt{Formulas\ \textgreater{}\ Insert\ Function}.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\tightlist
\item
  Below the cell \emph{Mean}, type the word \emph{Median}.
\item
  Click on the cell right next to it and type \texttt{=MEDIAN(A2:A101)}.
\item
  Below the cell \emph{Median}, type \emph{Stand. Dev.}
\item
  Click on the cell right next to it and type \texttt{=STDEV.S(A2:A101)} (sample standard deviation).
\item
  Excel does not have a \emph{Range} function, so below the standard deviation type the word \emph{Range} and next to it compute the range by using the formula \texttt{Range\ =\ Max\ –\ Min}.
\item
  Below the cell \emph{Range}, type \emph{Mode(s)}.
\end{enumerate}

You will investigate the many modes in the data set and what they are. For that, you will use the function \texttt{MODE.MULT()}. This function returns a vertical array of the most frequently occurring, that is, the mode(s) of the data set.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{8}
\tightlist
\item
  Starting with the cell next to the word \emph{Mode(s)}, select a vertical range of cells (a block of any number of vertical cells).
\item
  While the block of cells is selected, type the function \texttt{MODE.MULT(A2:A101)} into the Formula bar.
\item
  Press the keys \texttt{Control} + \texttt{Shift} + \texttt{Enter} (For MAC, use the keys \texttt{Command} + \texttt{Shift} + \texttt{Enter}).
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Note:} Be careful! If you only press Enter or use the function MODE, Excel will only display one value for the mode even if there are multiple modes.

\textbf{Note:} If there is no mode, \#N/A will appear as a result. If there is only one mode, MODE.MULT returns the same value repeatedly.

\begin{figure}

\textbf{Practice 2:}

Now you will do the same work above (Steps 1-10) for \emph{Samples 2} and \emph{3}.

\textbf{Note:} In the instructions above, you must adjust the cell addresses for Samples 2 and 3.

Compare the results obtained in Section \textbf{\ref{descriptive-stats}} with the results obtained in Section \textbf{\ref{excel-functions}}. The results should be the same.

\chapter{Measures of Location}\label{measures-of-location}}

\emph{Measures of location} are numbers that indicate the position of data values in a data set. In this lab, you will use Excel to determine measures of location in a distribution: percentiles and standard scores (\emph{z}-scores).

A \emph{percentile} represents the location of a value as a cumulative percentage. The \emph{k}-th (where 1 ≤ \emph{k} ≤ 99) percentile is the data value that indicates the \emph{k}\% percentage of all values in the data set that falls at or below it, and (100-\emph{k})\% of all data falls above it.

Another common measure of location is the standard value score, which relates to the distribution's spread. A \emph{standard score} (or \emph{z-score}) indicates the position of a value in terms of its distance to the mean in units of standard deviation.

\hypertarget{preparation-4}{%
\section{Preparation}\label{preparation-4}}

You will use a data set that provides measures of global atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide from 2002 to 2019.

Download the data set called Lab 7 Carbon Dioxide Concentrations.xlsx from here \href{https://github.com/bsosnovski/Intro-Stats-Excel-Lab-Manual/blob/main/Data_Sets/Lab-7-carbon-dioxide-concentrations.xlsx}{\textbf{https://github.com/bsosnovski/Intro-Stats-Excel-Lab-Manual/blob/main/Data\_Sets/Lab-7-carbon-dioxide-concentrations.xlsx}}.

Open the Excel file \emph{Lab 7 Carbon Dioxide Concentrations.xlsx} and follow the instructions below.

\hypertarget{percentiles}{%
\section{Percentiles}\label{percentiles}}

The function \texttt{PERCENTILE.INC(array,k)} returns the \emph{k}-th percentile of values in a data set, where \emph{k} is in the range 0..1, inclusive, representing the decimal form of the percentage. The function \texttt{PERCENTILE.EXC(array,k)} works similarly, but \emph{k} is exclusive in the range 0..1.

\emph{Example:} Suppose a data set contains the test scores for a class of 20 students, and you want to calculate the 80th percentile score. Assuming the test scores are in cells A1:A20, you would use the formula \texttt{=PERCENTILE.INC(A1:A20,\ 0.80)}. This formula will return the value at the 80th percentile in the data set, representing the score separating the top 20\% of students from the rest.

The following are instructions for you to find all percentiles of the carbon dioxide measured in \emph{Mauna Loa, Hawaii}, contained in the file you downloaded.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Go to the top of an empty column and type \emph{Percentiles- Mauna Loa, Hawaii} as the column's header.
\item
  Below \emph{Percentiles- Mauna Loa, Hawaii}, create a list of numbers from 1 to 99 (use the instructions in Section \textbf{\ref{seq-numbers}} from Lab \textbf{\ref{time-series}} \emph{Time Series and Measures of Central Tendency}).
\item
  In the column next to it, type the header \emph{Hawaii Measure}.
\item
  Below \emph{Hawaii Measure}, enter the formula \texttt{=PERCENTILE.INC(\$C\$4:\$C\$21,L2/100)}.
\item
  Select the cell containing the formula in Step 4.
\item
  Position the mouse pointer in the lower right corner of the selected cell until it becomes a \texttt{+} sign and click-drag downward across the range that covers all the values of the \emph{Hawaii measure}.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Note:} In the formula above, the address of the cells containing the data set has dollar signs (\texttt{\$}) before the row and the column number to keep the calculations from changing the location of the data set.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{percentiles}

\textbf{Note:} \texttt{PERCENTRANK.INC} uses interpolation to find percentiles for values that are not originally in the data set.

\hypertarget{percentile-ranks}{%
\section{Percentile Ranks}\label{percentile-ranks}}

The function \texttt{PERCENTRANK.INC(array,\ x,\ {[}significance{]})} calculates a specific value's relative position within a data set, expressed as a percentile rank between 0 and 1, inclusive. \emph{Significance} is an optional parameter. that identifies the number of significant digits for the returned percentage value. If omitted, \texttt{PERCENTRANK.INC} uses three digits (0.xxx).

\emph{Example:} Suppose that a data set contains the test scores for a class of 20 students, and you want to find the percentile rank of the value in cell A1. You would use the following formula \texttt{=PERCENTRANK.INC(A1)}. This formula will return the corresponding percentile of the value with three (3) decimal places.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Go to the top of another empty column and type \emph{Hawaii Measure} as the header of the column.
\item
  Copy the values in cells C4:C21 and paste them below the header \emph{Hawaii Measure}.
\item
  Below \emph{Percentile Rank}, enter the formula \texttt{=PERCENTRANK.INC\ (\$O\$2:\$O\$19,O2)}.
\item
  Select the cell containing the formula above.
\item
  Position the mouse pointer in the lower right corner of the selected cell until it becomes a \texttt{+} sign and click-drag downward across the range that covers all the values in Step 3. The results are in the decimal form.

\hypertarget{mean-st-dev}{%
\subsection{Calculating the Mean and Standard Deviation}\label{mean-st-dev}}

In this part of the lab, you will compute the mean and the standard deviation of the distribution of \emph{Hawaii Measures}.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  In an empty cell, type \emph{Mean} and next to the cell, compute the mean using the function \texttt{=AVERAGE(C4:C21)}.
\item
  In another empty cell type \emph{Stand Dev} and next to the cell, compute the standard deviation using the function \texttt{=STDEV.S(C4:C21)}.
\item
  In the \texttt{Number} ribbon, adjust the standard deviation value to have two (2) decimal places.
\end{enumerate}

The result for the mean is 391.51, and the standard deviation is 11.78.

\hypertarget{converting-to-z-scores}{%
\subsection{Converting to Z-Scores}\label{converting-to-z-scores}}

The function \texttt{STANDARDIZE(x,\ mean,\ stand\_dev)} returns a normalized value \emph{x} from a distribution characterized by mean and standard deviation. The normalized value is the same as the z-score of the value.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Go to the top of an empty column and type \emph{Z-Scores} as the column's header.
\item
  Below Z-Scores, use the function \texttt{=\ STANDARDIZE(C4,\ mean,\ stand\_dev)} to convert the value in cell C4 in the data set. In the formula, replace mean with the cell address containing the mean value from calculations in Section \textbf{\ref{mean-st-dev}}, and replace \texttt{stand\_dev} with the cell address with the standard deviation calculated. Include \texttt{\$} in the mean and standard deviation addresses since they are fixed for all data values.
\item
  Adjust the z-score to have two (2) decimal places.
\item
  Select the cell containing the formula in Step 2.
\item
  Position the mouse pointer in the lower right corner of the selected cell until it becomes a \texttt{+} sign and click-drag downward across the range that covers all the \emph{Hawaii measures}.
\end{enumerate}

As a result, the z-scores range from -1.55 to 1.69.

\chapter{Box and Whisker Plot}\label{box-and-whisker-plot}}

\emph{Quartiles} are quantiles (also percentiles) that divide the data into approximately four equal parts.

A \emph{box and whisker plot} is a graph showing the data distribution using the \emph{five-number-summary}: minimum value, first quartile, median (second quartile), third quartile, and maximum value. This type of graph is also known as a box plot.

The \emph{interquartile range} (\emph{IQR}) represents the spread of the middle half of the data and is calculated as the difference between the third and first quartiles.

In this lab, you will use a data set containing NY temperatures in September of 2013.

Download the data set called Lab 8 NY Temp Sept2013.xlsx from here \href{https://github.com/bsosnovski/Intro-Stats-Excel-Lab-Manual/blob/main/Data_Sets/Lab-8-NY-Temp-Sept2013.xlsx}{\textbf{https://github.com/bsosnovski/Intro-Stats-Excel-Lab-Manual/blob/main/Data\_Sets/Lab-8-NY-Temp-Sept2013.xlsx}}.

Open the Excel file \emph{Lab 8 NY Temp Sept2013.xlsx} and follow the instructions below.

\hypertarget{five-number-summary}{%
\section{Five-Number-Summary}\label{five-number-summary}}

Using Excel, you will compute the five-number summary, generate a box plot, and compute the interquartile range (IQR) for \emph{Lab 8 NY temperatures in the September 2013} workbook.

Use Excel to compute the following in an empty part of the worksheet.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Choose a cell and type \emph{Min}, and in the cell next to it, enter \texttt{=\ MIN(B3:B32)} to find the minimum value of the data set.
\item
  Below \emph{Min}, type \emph{Q1}, and in the cell next to it, enter \texttt{=\ QUARTILE(B3:B32,1)} to find the first quartile.
\item
  Below \emph{Q1}, type \emph{Q2}, and in the cell next to it, enter \texttt{=\ QUARTILE(B3:B32,2)} to find the second quartile.
\item
  Below \emph{Q2}, type \emph{Q3}, and in the cell next to it, enter \texttt{=\ QUARTILE(B3:B32,3)} to find the third quartile.
  5, Below \emph{Q3}, type \emph{Max}, and in the cell next to it, enter \texttt{=\ Max(B3:B32)} to find the maximum value of the data set.
\item
  Below \emph{Max}, type \emph{Median}, and enter \texttt{=\ MEDIAN(B3:B32)} next to it to compute the median.
\end{enumerate}

Be sure that your five-number summary is organized to display the results. For example:

Calculate the correlation coefficient.
Draw the regression line in your scatter plot
Answer to the following questions (you may refer to your notes or textbook):

\hypertarget{coin-toss-simulation}{%
\section{Coin Toss Simulation}\label{coin-toss-simulation}}

In Lab \textbf{\ref{number-gen}} \emph{Random Number Generators and Tables}, the function \texttt{RANDBETWEEN(Bottom,Top)} was used to obtain a random integer between (and including) the bottom and top numbers.

We can use the random number generator to simulate experiments such as tossing coins or rolling dice.

\hypertarget{simulating-a-coin-tossing-experiment}{%
\section{Simulating a Coin Tossing Experiment}\label{simulating-a-coin-tossing-experiment}}

To simulate the experiment, assign to the outcome \emph{Head} the digit \emph{1} and to \emph{Tail} the digit \emph{2}.

You will draw a random sample of size 30 in Column A from the distributions of integers with a minimum value of 1 to a maximum value of 2.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Write the label \emph{Coin Toss} in cell A1.
\item
  Type the formula \texttt{=\ RANDBETWEEN(1,2)} in cell A2 and press \texttt{Enter/Return}.
\item
  Select cell A2 again, position the mouse pointer in the lower right corner of the selected cell until it becomes a \texttt{+} sign, and click-drag downward across until cell A31.
\item
  Ensure that Excel randomizes all the values by going to the \texttt{Formula} tab in the menu bar and clicking the \texttt{Calculate\ Now} ribbon to apply the randomization. Column A should now have 30 random values.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{counting-the-number-of-heads-and-the-number-of-tails}{%
\section{Counting the Number of Heads and the Number of Tails}\label{counting-the-number-of-heads-and-the-number-of-tails}}

Next, you will use Excel to count the \emph{1}'s and \emph{2}'s in column A. You will set up a table in Columns C and D to display the results.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Type the label \emph{Outcome} in Cell C1.
\item
  Type the label \emph{Heads} in Cell C2.
\item
  Type the label \emph{Tails} in Cell C3.
\item
  Type the label \emph{Frequency} in Cell D1.
\end{enumerate}

You will use the formula \texttt{COUNTIF(data\ range,\ condition)} to count the \emph{1}'s and \emph{2}'s as the formula's conditions. Recall that we assigned the number \emph{1} to the outcome \emph{Head} and the number \emph{2} to the \emph{Tail}.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Select cell D2, and enter the formula \texttt{=\ COUNTIF(A2:A31,1)}.
\item
  Next, select cell D3, and enter \texttt{=\ COUNTIF(A2:A31,2)}.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{calculating-the-empirical-probability}{%
\section{Calculating the Empirical Probability}\label{calculating-the-empirical-probability}}

\emph{Empirical Probability} is based on experience or historical data to determine the likelihood of outcomes. It is calculated by determining the relative frequency. You will calculate the observed probabilities of the outcomes \emph{Heads} and \emph{Tails} you simulated.

To calculate the relative frequency of an outcome, calculate the number of times the outcomes appear divided by the total number of all outcomes.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Enter the label \emph{Rel Freq} in cell E1.
\item
  In cell E2, enter \texttt{=\ D2/30}.
\item
  In cell E3, enter \texttt{=\ D3/30}.
\item
  Select the cells E2 and E3 and go to the \texttt{Home} tab, and then adjust the results to have four (4) decimal places in the \texttt{Number} ribbon.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Practice:}

Repeat this process to generate another simulation with 500 \emph{Coin Tosses} in any empty cells of the \emph{Lab 9} worksheet.
