Statistical methodology can be found in surveys, sampling, clinical trials, studies of biomedical treatments, digital marketing, finance, etc. In recent years, Statistics has undergone changes in its techniques and approaches because of the need to analyze exceptionally large and complex data sets that arise all around us but cannot be done by hand. Since we have more powerful computers available to us at the present time, we can employ them to analyze these large data sets. Thus, it is even more important to learn how to use computer applications for statistical analysis, enhancing technology skills effectively for academic research and lifelong learning. About this Manual This manual has been written as a companion text for an introductory statistics course using Excel software. Topics include descriptive statistics; probability; binomial and normal distributions; sampling; confidence intervals and tests of hypotheses. This text is to be used as a tutorial on how to use Excel to learn some fundamentals concepts covered in a typical Introduction to Statistics course and as a tool to advance technology skills effectively for academic research and lifelong learning. It is to be used alongside lectures and/or textbooks in such a course. This text is not a comprehensive introduction to Excel or Statistics. The mathematical equations required for statistical concepts such as the mean and the standard deviation have not been provided as these are easily performed with functions in Excel.

"],["introduction.html", "Introduction", " Introduction Microsoft Excel® is a spreadsheet software for business applications available in the Microsoft Office® package. Excel enables users to format, organize, and calculate data with formulas and functions. This basic Excel lab manual provides students and the novice with the skills needed to use Excel’s built-in statistical functions and how to produce some useful graphs. It also prepares them for more advanced skills using the Excel software. Although Excel is a powerful tool for executing many personal and professional activities, it is not a statistical data analysis package. It was never designed to be one, but it has the Data Analysis ToolPak, an extra feature extending Excel’s standard capabilities. Data Analysis ToolPak enables users to perform various statistical analyses in Excel. In many cases, macros (automated actions that can be used repeatedly to perform a task or tasks) can be created to produce special graphs, such as box-and-whisker plots. However, this manual only shows how to use some of the existing built-in features and the Data Analysis ToolPak. The Analysis ToolPak is part of Excel and can be added to the basic Excel program as an option on the program’s list of Add-ins. The details for getting started with the Analysis ToolPak are presented in Chapter 1 of this manual. No additional software is required to use the Excel functions described. Excel runs slightly differently on MACs and PCs. Whenever there is a difference between Excel for Mac and PC on performing a task, each system’s instructions in this lab will be provided separately. Otherwise, the same set of instructions is applied to both systems.

On most campuses, students can also remotely access a computer lab at their specific campus. If obtaining Excel via Microsoft 365, download the software to your machine. Do not run Excel from the cloud. Running it from the cloud does not give students access to the Analysis ToolPak (see Section 1.4). 1.1 The Excel Window Note that in the Excel Windows shown in Figures 1.1 and 1.2, the title bar shows Book1 as a temporary name for the file. When opening a new Excel file (also called a Workbook, see Section 1.6), it has a suggested temporary name, Book1, Book2, etc, depending on how many new files are open before saving them. When saying it for the first, Excel will prompt the user to rename it. 1.1.1 The Excel Window on a PC Figure 1.1: Excel Window on a PC. 1.1.2 The Excel Window on a MAC Figure 1.2: Excel Window on a MAC (in Dark Mode). 1.2 Saving Excel Files On the main menu, click File &gt; Save As when saving for the first time. A dialog will appear, similar to the one in figure 1.3. Fill in the file name, select the directory of your choice where the file will be saved on your machine, and the file type, for example, file with extensions .xlsx or .xls. Figure 1.3: Dialog window when saving a workbook on a PC. Figure 1.4: Dialog window when saving a workbook on a MAC. After using the Save As feature, you can use the Save command to overwrite your previously saved file with the file in its current state. After saving the Excel file for the first time, you can save the updates during your working session using the save button on the title toolbar. Figure 1.5: Saving options. It is essential to save your Excel files whenever you start a new project or periodically when you make changes to an existing file. Saving early and often can prevent your work from being lost. You’ll also need to pay close attention to where you save the workbook so it will be easy to find later. You can also turn on the AutoSave feature to save your data automatically while working on Excel. The following are the steps to turn on Auto-save. 1.2.1 AutoSave on a PC Click the File tab. Click on Options. In the Options dialog window, click on the Save option on the left. Check the option Save AutoRecover information every. By default, the value is 10 minutes, but you can choose a lower or higher value. Then click Ok. Figure 1.6: AutoSave option on PC. 1.2.2 AutoSave on a Mac On the Excel title bar, click Preferences. Under the category Sharing and Privacy, click Save. Select the AutoSave or AutoRecover info in every check window, and then enter how frequently you want to save the Excel files. Figure 1.7: Dropdown menu in the Excel title bar. Figure 1.8: Save option in Excel Preferences A shortcut is available on Mac to activate the AutoSave. You can just toggle ON the AutoSave option in the Toolbar of the program. Figure 1.9: AutoSave option in the Toolbar. Note: AutoSave in Excel is a special feature for Microsoft 365 subscription accounts. When you save your Excel spreadsheet online on OneDrive or SharePoint, Excel activates the AutoSave feature. AutoSave in Excel saves your progress every few seconds so that all changes appear online if someone else is working on the same file. 1.3 Opening an Excel File To open an Excel file, go to the main menu and click File &gt; Open. Select the directory containing the file, then select the file you want to open. 1.4 The Analysis ToolPak You may need to install the Analysis ToolPak from the original Excel software if your computer does not have it. 1.4.1 Adding the Analysis ToolPak on a PC With an Excel worksheet open: Click on File in the main menu. Click on Options. Click Add-ins (left side menu) to see if the ToolPak is listed in the Active Application Add-ins. If it is, the ToolPak is installed. If you do not see a listing for Analysis ToolPak in Active Application Add-ins, it may be under the list of inactive applications. IYou must install it from the original Excel installation source if you do not see it. To install or activate it, click Go. Check the box next to Analysis ToolPak. Click OK. Figure 1.10: Excel Options on a PC. Figure 1.11: Add-ins Options on a PC. 1.4.2 Adding the Analysis ToolPak on a Mac With an Excel worksheet open: Click on Tools in the main menu. Click on Add-ins and see if the Analysis ToolPak is listed as an active application. If it is not, check the box next to it. Click OK. Figure 1.12: Excel Tools on a MAC. Figure 1.13: Add-ins Options on a MAC. 1.5 Checking if the Analysis ToolPak is Active Click on the tab Data. You should be able to see it as a ribbon on the top right of your Excel Window. Figure 1.14: Data tab and Analysis ToolPak ribbon. 1.6 The Excel Workbook The workbook is an Excel file that consists of one or more worksheets. The tabs near the bottom of the screen show that we are working with Sheet 1 (check Figures 1.1 and 1.2) . To change worksheets, click on the corresponding worksheet tab. Alternatively, you can RIGHT-click (or Control + click) the arrows just to the left of the worksheet tabs to get a list of all the worksheets in the projects and select a worksheet. 1.6.1 The Cells in the Worksheet When you look at a worksheet, you should see horizontal and vertical grid lines. Grid lines are light grey lines that appear around cells on Microsoft Excel worksheets. If they are missing, you will need to activate that feature. To do so, see lines: Select the View tab. Click the Show group on the tab. Be sure that the Gridlines option is checked or selected. Figure 1.15: Gridlines option in the View tab. 1.6.2 Cell Addresses Intersecting rows and columns form the cells. A cell’s address consists of a column letter followed by a row number. For example, address B3 designates the cell in Column B, Row 3. When Cell B3 is highlighted, it is the active cell, which means we can enter text or numbers into Cell B3. 1.6.3 Selecting Cells To select a cell, position the cursor in the cell and click the left mouse button (or click on your computer’s trackpad). Sometimes you will want to select several cells simultaneously to format them (as described next). To select a rectangular block of cells, position the cursor in a corner cell, hold down the left mouse button, drag the cursor to the cell in the opposite corner of the block, and release the button. Figure 1.16: A block of cells selected in the worksheet. To select an entire column, click on the letter above the column to be selected; to select an entire row, click on the number to its left. To select every cell in the worksheet, click on the blank gray rectangle in the upper left corner of the worksheet (above row header 1 and left of column header A). You can also select a block of cells by typing the two corner cells into the active cell address window. For example, typing B3:E4 and pressing Enter would select the rectangular block of cells from B3 to the opposite corner E4. 1.6.4 Formatting Cell Contents In Excel, you may place text or numbers in a cell. As in other Windows applications, you can format the text or numbers by using the formatting toolbar buttons for bold (B), italics (I), underline (U), etc. Other options include left, right, and centered alignment within a cell. Figure 1.17: Text Formatting ribbon in the Home tab. Numbers can be formatted to represent dollar amounts ($) or percent form (%) and can be shown with commas in large numbers (,). The number of decimal places to which numbers are carried is also adjustable. All these options appear on the formatting menu bar. Other options are accessible by RIGHT-clicking on a cell and selecting Format Cells. Figure 1.18: Number Formatting ribbon in the Home tab. 1.6.5 Changing Cell Width Column widths and row heights can be adjusted by placing the cursor between two columns’ letters or row numbers. Hold the left mouse button down when the cursor changes appearance, move the column or row boundary, and release. All these instructions may seem a little mysterious, but once you try them, you will find that they are fairly easy to remember. 1.7 Entering Data In Excel, we enter data and labels in the cells. It is common to select a column for the data and place a label as the first entry of the column. 1.7.1 Entering and Correcting Data To select a cell for content entry, move the mouse pointer to the cell and click. Then type the label or data and press Enter. Excel automatically moves to select the next cell in the same column. If you want to enter information in a different cell, click on it. Errors are easily fixed. If you notice a mistake before you press Enter, back-arrow to the mistake and correct it. If you see the error after you have pressed Enter, select the affected cell, and then click on the formula bar to add a typing cursor to the cell contents displayed. Use standard keyboard editing techniques to make corrections, then press Enter. If you want to erase the contents of a cell or range of cells but keep the formatting: Select the cells and click Home Click the arrow next to Clear Select Clear Content (or press Delete) The Clear &gt; Clear Formats option keeps the content but clears the format. The Clear &gt; Clear All option removes both content and format. Note: Clear &gt; Formats is handy for changing percent data back into decimal format. 1.7.2 Practice 1 The number of ads and the time devoted to ads were recorded for every twenty hours of prime-time viewing. Enter the data as shown in Figure 1.19 in your Excel workbook. Figure 1.19: Excel worksheet with data. 1.8 Arithmetic Options on the Standard Toolbar 1.8.1 Sum Function On the Formula Menu, the button you see in Figure 1.20 automatically sums the values in the selected cells. Figure 1.20: Autosum button. When we sum the contents of an entire column, Excel places the sum under the selected cells. It is a good idea to type the label Total next to the cell where the total appears. 1.8.2 Practice 2 For the data you entered in your worksheet (see Practice 1), select cells in Column A containing numerical values (a2:a21). Press the button AutoSum, then type the word Total in the corresponding row of Column C. We see that the sum of Column A is 419. 1.8.3 Sorting Data The Sort and Filter ribbon on the Home tab shown in Figure 1.21 can be used to sort the data in ascending or descending depending on the selection from the sub-menu. Figure 1.21: Sort and Filter buttons. To sort just one column, highlight that column and press the button and select the sort order. To sort two or more columns by ascending or descending order of the data in the first column, highlight all the columns and click the appropriate button. In general, we will sort one column of data. 1.8.4 Practice 3 Sort the data in the first column in ascending order. Now undo the ordering you just did to your data. – If you have not made any other changes since you did the sort, you can use Undo function of Excel from the Title Bar from the main menu. The data will appear in their original order. – Another option to undo actions in Excel, use the keys CRTL-Z on a PC keyboard or Command-Z on a MAC. After Step 2 above, your data set should be in the original form. 1.8.5 Copying Cells To copy one cell or a block of cells to another location on the worksheet: Select the cells you wish to copy. From the Home tab, select Copy (the shortcut with the keyboard for this process is CRTL-C on PC or Command-C on MAC). Notice that the range of cells being copied now has a blinking border around it. Select the upper-left cell of the block that will receive the copy. Press Enter. When you press Enter, the copy process is complete, and the blinking border around the original cells disappears. Note: Even if you use the command Paste or the shortcut CRTL-V on PC or Command-V on MAC to paste, you must still press Enter to remove the blinking border around the original cells. To copy one cell or a range of cells to another worksheet or workbook, follow Steps 1 and 2 above. For Step 3, be sure you are in the destination worksheet or workbook and that the worksheet or workbook is activated. Then proceed to Step 4. 1.8.6 Practice 4 Copy the contents of columns A and B and paste them into columns F and G. Then sort the data in Column F in descending order Also, copy the contents of columns A and B and paste them into columns J and K. Then custom sort the data in Columns J and K by the values in Column J in ascending order After Step 2 above, your worksheet should have 3 sets of data where the two (2) rightmost ones have modifications in the ordering of the columns according to the instructions in the practice above. 1.9 Using Formulas A formula is an expression that generates a numerical value in a cell (like a calculator), usually based on values in other cells. Formulas usually involve standard arithmetic operations. Excel uses + for addition, - (hyphen) for subtraction, * for multiplication, / for division, and ^ (carat) for exponentiation (raising to a power). For instance, if we want to divide the contents of Cell A2 by the contents of Cell B2 and place the results in Cell C2, we do the following: Make Cell C2 the active cell. Click in the formula bar and type =A2/B2. Press Enter. Cell C2 will be the quotient of the values in Cells A2 and B2. If for a whole series of rows, we wanted to divide the entry in Column A by the entry in Column B and put the results in Column C, we could repeat the above process over and over. However, the typing would be tedious. We can accomplish the same thing more easily by replicating the formula in one cell in other cells. 1.9.1 Practice 5 Enter =A2/B2 in Cell C2 as described above. Move the cursor to the lower right corner of Cell C2. The cursor should change shape to a small black cross (+). Hold down the left mouse button and drag the + down until all the cells in Column C where you want the calculation done are highlighted. Release the mouse button (you may need to press Enter right after, depending on how your Excel program is configured). The cell entries in Column C should equal the quotients of the same-row entries in Columns A and B. 1.10 Adjustment to Formulas Now, if you click on one of the lower cells in Column C, you will see that the row number in the cell addresses is not 2, but rather the number of the new cell’s row. Generally, when a formula is copied from one cell to another, the cell addresses in the formula are automatically adjusted. For example, if the formula =D3+C7 is copied to a new cell, three columns right and two rows up from the old one, the pasted formula comes out as =G1+F5. (Three columns right from D is G, two rows up from 3 is 1, and so on.) Sometimes you will want to prevent the automatic address adjustment. To do this, put a dollar sign before any row or column number you want to keep from changing. When the formula =D$3+$C7 is copied to a new cell, three columns right and two rows up from the old one, the pasted formula comes out as =G$3+$C5. We will call an address with two $ signs in an absolute address because it always refers to the same cell ($ fix the addresses in a formula), no matter where the formula is copied/pasted. For a cell with only one $ sign in it or none, we will call a relative address because the cell referred to can change as the formula is pasted from one location to another. "],["number-gen.html", "Lab 2 Random Number Generators and Tables 2.1 Random Samples 2.2 Setting the Workbook to Manual Calculation 2.3 Using the Recalculation Mode 2.4 Creating Tables", " Lab 2 Random Number Generators and Tables 2.1 Random Samples Excel has few random number generators. The other random functions are RAND(), which returns an evenly distributed random real number greater than or equal to 0 and less than 1, and RANDARRAY(rows,columns,min,max,integer), which Returns an array of random numbers. For RANDARRAY, you can specify the number of rows and columns to fill, minimum and maximum values, and whether to return whole numbers or decimal values. We focus now on the RANDBETWEEN function. 2.1.1 Insert the function RANDBETWEEN on a PC To use RANDBETWEEN, select a cell in the active worksheet. Click in the formula tab and then click the Insert Function ribbon. Figure 2.1: Insert Function ribbon. Select the category All in the dialog window. Then select RANDBETWEEN and then fill in the bottom and top numbers. Returns a random integer number between the numbers you specify. Figure 2.2: The dialog window of Insert Function on PC. 2.1.2 Insert the function RANDBETWEEN on a MAC Click on the Formula tab. Click the Insert Function ribbon. You will see on the right side of the Excel window that the Formula Builder appears. In the search box, start to type a keyword for the function you are looking for. Excel will list functions that match the criteria of the search you type. Then select the function you wish to insert in the worksheet. In this case, the RANDBETWEEN function. Adjust the arguments of the formula (top and bottom numbers) as needed. Figure 2.3: Dialog window of Insert Function on MAC. Note: Alternatively, you can simply type =RANDBETWEEN(bottom,top) in the formula bar, with numbers in place of bottom and top for the arguments of the formula. 2.2 Setting the Workbook to Manual Calculation The random number generators of Excel have the characteristic that whenever a command is entered anywhere in the active workbook, the random numbers change because they are recalculated. To prevent this from happening, change the recalculate mode from automatic to manual. 2.2.1 Manual Calculation on a PC Select File then Options. Click on the tab labeled Formulas. Select Manual Calculation for Workbook Calculation and uncheck the option Recalculate workbook before saving. Then press OK. Figure 2.4: Calculation options under Formulas in a PC. 2.2.2 Manual Calculation on a MAC Go to Excel Menu then select Preferences Figure 2.5: Preferences in the Excel Menu on a MAC. Under Formulas and Lists, click on Calculation Figure 2.6: Formulas and Lists in Preferences on a MAC. For Workbook Calculation, select Manual calculation and uncheck the option Recalculate workbook before saving. Figure 2.7: Calculation Options on a MAC. 2.3 Using the Recalculation Mode Even if the Calculation option is set for Manual, you can use a ribbon command or keyboard shortcut to force a recalculation when needed. You can still recalculate by pressing the keys Shift + F9 on the keyboard on a PC (For MAC, use keys Command + = ) or pressing the button Calculate Now in the Formulas Menu. Figure 2.8: Calculation ribbon. 2.3.1 Practice 1 Suppose that there are 95 students enrolled in a section of the course Introductory Statistics. Draw a random sample of fifteen (15) of the students. To draw the sample, assign each of the students a distinct number between 1 and 95. To find the numbers of the 15 students to be included in the sample, do the following steps. Change the calculation mode to Manual (as described above). Type the label Sample in Cell A1 , Select Cell A2. Type =RANDBETWEEN(1,95) in the formula bar and press Enter. Position the mouse pointer in the lower right corner of Cell A2 until it becomes a + sign, and click-drag downward until you reach Cell A16. Release. Then press the key F9 (or Calculate Now button). Use one of the Sort buttons to sort the data to easily check for repetitions. If there are repetitions, press Shift + F9 (or Calculate Now) again and re-sort. Below, with the data sorted, we can verify that there are no repetitions 2.4 Creating Tables To make working with data easier, you can organize data in a table format on a worksheet. You are going to use Excel’s random number generator and tables to create a fictional grade book. 2.4.1 Practice 2 Select the block of cells D1:H11. On the Home tab, in the Styles ribbon, click Format as Table, and then click the table style of your choice. Figure 2.9: Style ribbon. Select the My table has headers check box in the Format as Table dialog window. Figure 2.10: 32: Format As Table window. Note: When you select a table by clicking the mouse pointer, the Table Tools menu becomes available, and a Design tab is displayed. To get a good idea of what you can add to or change in your table, click the Design tab, then explore the groups and options provided on this tab. Replace the table headers. Instead of Columns1 through Column5, replace headers by typing in them the following: Name, Exam 1, Exam 2, Exam 3 and Final Exam. Under header Name, in cells 2-11, create 10 students’ names, writing last name, and first name. Now select the block of cells D2:D11. Click Home &gt; Sort &amp; Filter &gt; Select A to Z. The fictional names should then appear in alphabetical order. Select cell E2. Click on the Formula bar, type in =RANDBETWEEN(0,100). Position the mouse pointer in the lower right corner of cell E2 until it becomes a + sign and click-drag downward until you reach cell E11. Release (Note: Sometimes this feature is not needed within a formatted table). Repeat the process above for Column F using =RANDBETWEEN(40,98). Repeat the process above for Column G using =RANDBETWEEN(64,105). Repeat the process above for Column H using =RANDBETWEEN(37,100). If the list of numbers is not randomized, click the button Calculate Now.

Start by determining minimum and maximum values in a data set, class width, the lower and upper limits of classes of values, class boundaries, midpoints, etc. This is similar in Excel. You will need the upper-class limits and the midpoints for adjusting the graph created with Excel. Throughout this manual, Select means to left-click with the mouse/pad. 3.1 Preparation In this lab, you will use a data set that contains scores received on an MA-336 Exam. Download the data set. called Lab 3 Exam Scores.xlsx from here: https://github.com/bsosnovski/Intro-Stats-Excel-Lab-Manual/blob/main/Data_Sets/Lab-3-Exam-Scores.xlsx Open the Excel file you downloaded and follow the instructions below. 3.2 Initial Computations Select cell C1 and in the formula bar type in =COUNT(A2:A33). Note: You can fill in the input range, A2:A33, in the formula count above by manually typing the address of the cells containing the data values. Alternatively, you can select cells that form the Input Range by clicking on A2, holding, and dragging downward until you reach cell A33. Then release. Type in cell D1 the label Total number of data entries. Select cell C2 and in the formula bar type in =MIN(A2:A33). Type in cell D2 the label Min. Select cell C3 and in the formula bar type in =MAX(A2:A33). Type in cell D3 the label Max. Select cell C4 and in the formula bar type in =(C3-C2)/5. Type in cell D4 the label Width Computation. Round up the value resulting in cell C4 to the next whole number by using the formula =ROUNDUP(C4,0) in cell C5 the adjusted value for the width. Note: The formula above uses the cell address (C4) to identify the number to be rounded up with 0 decimal places. Type in cell D5 the label Width. Figure 3.1: Initial computations for constructing a histogram. 3.3 Class Limit Calculations Type in cell C7 the label Lower Limits. In cell C8, type the formula = C2. This will copy the value in cell C2 as the histogram’s lower limit for the first class. Select cell C9, and in the formula bar, type =SUM(C8,$C$5). Remember the dollar sign because the value in C5, the width, is a fixed value for all formulas you use here. Note: You may also do the computation in Step 3 above using the keyboard key +. Position the mouse pointer in the lower right corner of cell C9 until it becomes a + sign and click, hold, and drag downward until you reach cell C12. Then release. Note: You should have a total of 5 class limits since your histogram has 5 classes. Note: If the formulas do not update automatically, do Step 5 below. Otherwise, skip to Step 6. Select Formulas&gt;Calculate Now. Type in cell D7 the label Upper Limits. 7.Type the values of the upper limits of each class in cells D8 through D12. Note: You can also be creative and use a formula to do the work in this step. There are different ways of entering the upper limits using formulas, but that is not being requested from you for this lab. Type in cell E7 the label Midpoints. Compute the values of the midpoints (lower limit + upper limit)/2 of each class in cells E8 through E12 by using Excel formulas. Note: To do this step, use the techniques and Excel functions presented above (create the Excel formula!) Figure 3.2: Class limits computations. 3.4 Creating the Histogram Select Data&gt;Data Analysis&gt;Histogram and click OK. Note: If Data Analysis does not appear in the Data menu, refer to the instructions in Lab 1 Getting Started with Excel how to make it available. In the dialog window, first click in the Input Range field then type in $A$2:$A$33. Note: Instead of typing, you can select cells that form the Input Range by clicking on A2, holding, and dragging downward until you reach cell A33. Then release. Click the Bin Range field in the dialog window first, then type in $D$8:$D$12. Note: You can also select cells containing the upper limits instead of typing‼! You have the option to have the graph placed in a specific cell or range of cells (for this option check Output Range as in the picture above, you may select a different cell address) or in a new worksheet (for this check option New Worksheet Ply). In the pop-up window, Check the boxes for Cumulative Percentage and Chart Output. Then click OK. Figure 3.3: Dialog window with the histogram options. After the steps above, Excel presents a frequency table and the corresponding graph. Excel counts the frequency of each class based on the Bins values you entered in the dialog window for the histogram. Thus, it counts how many values are in the date set (Input Range) up to the upper limits. The graph is a raw histogram that needs to be adjusted to resemble an actual histogram. Figure 3.4: Resulting histogram. 3.5 Removing the More bar of the Histogram If you chose New Worksheet Ply in Step 4 above, select the Worksheet that contains the graph. Otherwise, go to next Step 2 below. You may resize the graph by clicking anywhere within the figure. Handles appear along the perimeter of the graph. You can change the shape of the figure by clicking on a handle and dragging it. Make your graph to be displayed in an appropriate size. A frequency table was created with the graph in the process. That table controls some aspects of the graph. Select the cells in the last row of the frequency table, the one that contains the word More. Select &gt;Home&gt;Delete (you can also do this by RIGHT-clicking on the selected cells and then the option Delete). Note: If you do not delete the row in the table, the graph will contain an extra bar on the right of the graph with a frequency equal to zero. Be sure to delete the cells and not just delete the contents in those cells. If the graph doesn’t update automatically, select Formulas&gt;Calculate Now. Figure 3.5: Deleting the More row from the frequency table of the histogram. After Steps 4-5, the last column in the graph, labeled More will no longer be displayed in the graph. RIGHT-click on any one of the vertical bars of the graph and then select Format Data Point (or Format Data Series). Alternatively, you can also double-click with your mouse on a vertical for that. Move Gap Width to position 0% (this makes the bars of the graph touch). 3.6 Adjusting the Horizontal Axis 3.6.1 MAC RIGHT-click on any vertical bar of the graph. From the menu, click the option Select Data. Click Edit under Horizontal (Category) Axis Labels. Click and drag over the range E8:E12 (midpoints). Click OK. This is to re-label the x-axis with the midpoints replacing the upper limits. Click OK again.

A measure of central tendency shows where the center or middle of the data set is located. A measure of variation shows the spread among data values. Throughout these instructions, Select means to left-click with the mouse/pad. 4.1 Preparation In this lab, you will use a data set that contains three samples. You will compute descriptive statistics in different ways. Download the data set called Lab 4 Samples.xlsx from here: https://github.com/bsosnovski/Intro-Stats-Excel-Lab-Manual/blob/main/Data_Sets/Lab-4-Samples.xlsx Sample 1 contains 100 data values.

Figure 4.1: Data Analysis dialog window. The Descriptive Statistics window should appear. Complete the Descriptive Statistics window with the information needed from the data in Sample 1. The Input Range for Sample 1 has cell address $A$2:$A$101 (not including the label). If you include the label cell in the address, the address is $A$1:$A$101 (the first cell address is different). You may want to fill in the input range by manually typing the address or by selecting the cells. If the data values are stacked in a column, then check the options Grouped by Columns. If they were entered into Rows instead, then you would select the rows option. After you filled in the input range field, check or uncheck the box Labels in the first row according to what is in the input range. Check the option Output Range and select a cell in a blank area of your worksheet. 8.Check the option Summary statistics. Figure 4.2: Descriptive Statistics dialog window. These options give you the statistics of Sample 1 such as mean, median, standard deviation, and others.

Note: In the instructions above, you must adjust the cell addresses for Samples 2 and 3. 4.3 Using Excel’s Functions to Obtain the Measures Sample 1 Next to the column containing Sample 1 (between Sample 1 and Sample 2), click on an empty cell of the worksheet and type Mean. Click on the cell right next to it and type =AVERAGE(A2:A101). Note: You can also use the Excel function Average by clicking: Formulas &gt; Insert Function. Below the cell Mean, type the word Median. Click on the cell right next to it and type =MEDIAN(A2:A101). Below the cell Median, type Stand. Dev. Click on the cell right next to it and type =STDEV.S(A2:A101) (sample standard deviation). Note: The STDEV.P calculates the standard deviation based on the entire population given as arguments and the STDEV.S estimates the standard deviation base on a sample. Excel does not have a Range function, so below the standard deviation type the word Range and next to it compute the range by using the formula Range = Max – Min. Below the cell Range, type Mode(s). You will investigate the many modes in the data set and what they are. For that, you will use the function MODE.MULT(). This function returns a vertical array of the most frequently occurring, that is, the mode(s) of the data set. Starting with the cell next to the word Mode(s), select a vertical range of cells (a block of any number of vertical cells). While the block of cells is selected, type the function MODE.MULT(A2:A101) into the Formula bar. Press the keys Control + Shift + Enter (For MAC, use the keys Command + Shift + Enter). Note: Be careful! If you only press Enter or use the function MODE, Excel will only display one value for the mode even if there are multiple modes. Note: If there is no mode, #N/A will appear as a result. If there is only one mode, MODE.MULT returns the same value repeatedly.

In this lab, you will use Excel to determine measures of location in a distribution: percentiles and standard scores (z-scores). A percentile represents the location of a value as a cumulative percentage. The k-th (where 1 ≤ k ≤ 99) percentile is the data value that indicates the k% percentage of all values in the data set that falls at or below it, and (100-k)% of all data falls above it. Another common measure of location is the standard value score, which relates to the distribution’s spread. A standard score (or z-score) indicates the position of a value in terms of its distance to the mean in units of standard deviation. 7.1 Preparation You will use a data set that provides measures of global atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide from 2002 to 2019. Download the data set called Lab 7 Carbon Dioxide Concentrations.xlsx from here https://github.com/bsosnovski/Intro-Stats-Excel-Lab-Manual/blob/main/Data_Sets/Lab-7-carbon-dioxide-concentrations.xlsx. Open the Excel file Lab 7 Carbon Dioxide Concentrations.xlsx and follow the instructions below. 7.2 Percentiles The function PERCENTILE.INC(array,k) returns the k-th percentile of values in a data set, where k is in the range 0..1, inclusive, representing the decimal form of the percentage. The function PERCENTILE.EXC(array,k) works similarly, but k is exclusive in the range 0..1. Example: Suppose a data set contains the test scores for a class of 20 students, and you want to calculate the 80th percentile score. Assuming the test scores are in cells A1:A20, you would use the formula =PERCENTILE.INC(A1:A20, 0.80). This formula will return the value at the 80th percentile in the data set, representing the score separating the top 20% of students from the rest. The following are instructions for you to find all percentiles of the carbon dioxide measured in Mauna Loa, Hawaii, contained in the file you downloaded. Go to the top of an empty column and type Percentiles- Mauna Loa, Hawaii as the column’s header. Below Percentiles- Mauna Loa, Hawaii, create a list of numbers from 1 to 99 (use the instructions in Section 5.3.4 from Lab 5 Time Series and Measures of Central Tendency). In the column next to it, type the header Hawaii Measure. Below Hawaii Measure, enter the formula =PERCENTILE.INC($C$4:$C$21,L2/100). Select the cell containing the formula in Step 4. Position the mouse pointer in the lower right corner of the selected cell until it becomes a + sign and click-drag downward across the range that covers all the values of the Hawaii measure. Note: In the formula above, the address of the cells containing the data set has dollar signs ($) before the row and the column number to keep the calculations from changing the location of the data set. Figure 7.1: Percentiles calculations for Hawaii measures. Note: PERCENTRANK.INC uses interpolation to find percentiles for values that are not originally in the data set. 7.3 Percentile Ranks The function PERCENTRANK.INC(array, x, [significance]) calculates a specific value’s relative position within a data set, expressed as a percentile rank between 0 and 1, inclusive. Significance is an optional argument. that identifies the number of significant digits for the returned percentage value. If omitted, PERCENTRANK.INC uses three digits (0.xxx). Example: Suppose that a data set contains the test scores for a class of 20 students, and you want to find the percentile rank of the value in cell A1. You would use the following formula =PERCENTRANK.INC(A1). This formula will return the corresponding percentile of the value with three (3) decimal places. Go to the top of another empty column and type Hawaii Measure as the header of the column. Copy the values in cells C4:C21 and paste them below the header Hawaii Measure. Below Percentile Rank, enter the formula =PERCENTRANK.INC ($O$2:$O$19,O2). Select the cell containing the formula above. Position the mouse pointer in the lower right corner of the selected cell until it becomes a + sign and click-drag downward across the range that covers all the values in Step 3. The results are in the decimal form. Figure 7.2: Percentile rank calculations for the Hawaii measures. Note: To convert the results to percentages, select the values in the column Percentile Rank, go to the Home tab, and then change the format to Percentages in the Number ribbon. Figure 7.3: Numbers ribbon in the Home tab displaying the Percentage format. 7.3.1 Practice 1 Use Excel to calculate the percentiles and percentile ranks of the values in the column South Pole, Antarctica, in Lab 7 Carbon Dioxide Concentrations.xlsx. 7.4 Standard Scores The standard score (z) indicates the location of a value in the distribution as a function of how far the value is from the mean of the distribution in terms of the standard deviation. 7.4.1 Calculating the Mean and Standard Deviation In this part of the lab, you will compute the mean and the standard deviation of the distribution of Hawaii Measures. In an empty cell, type Mean and next to the cell, compute the mean using the function =AVERAGE(C4:C21). In another empty cell type Stand Dev and next to the cell, compute the standard deviation using the function =STDEV.S(C4:C21). In the Number ribbon, adjust the standard deviation value to have two (2) decimal places. The result for the mean is 391.51, and the standard deviation is 11.78. 7.4.2 Converting to Z-Scores The function STANDARDIZE(x, mean, stand_dev) returns a normalized value x from a distribution characterized by mean and standard deviation. The normalized value is the same as the z-score of the value. Go to the top of an empty column and type Z-Scores as the column’s header. Below Z-Scores, use the function = STANDARDIZE(C4, mean, stand_dev) to convert the value in cell C4 in the data set. In the formula, replace mean with the cell address containing the mean value from calculations in Section 7.4.1, and replace stand_dev with the cell address with the standard deviation calculated. Include $ in the mean and standard deviation addresses since they are fixed for all data values. Adjust the z-score to have two (2) decimal places. Select the cell containing the formula in Step 2. Position the mouse pointer in the lower right corner of the selected cell until it becomes a + sign and click-drag downward across the range that covers all the Hawaii measures. As a result, the z-scores range from -1.55 to 1.69. 7.4.3 Practice 2 Use Excel to calculate the z-scores of the values in the column South Pole, Antarctica in Lab 7 Carbon Dioxide Concentrations.xlsx.

The mean and the standard deviation parameters determine the normal distribution. In this lab, you will use the AVERAGE and STDEV.S functions to calculate the data’s mean and standard deviation, respectively. The NORM.DIST(x,mean,standard_dev,cumulative) function returns the normal distribution for the specified mean and standard deviation. In this case, we will use the false argument for cumulative since we will get the corresponding probability for the respective x values. The NORM.INV(probability,mean,standard_dev) function returns the z-score in a normal cumulative distribution for the specified mean and standard deviation. The STANDARDIZE(x, mean, standard_dev) function returns a normalized value from a mean and standard deviation distribution. 11.1 Preparation You will use a data set on baby birth, including the variables birthweight, mother’s age, mother’s weight, mother’s height, and whether the mother is a smoker. There are one thousand (1000) cases included in this data set. Download the data set called Lab 11 Babies.xlsx from here https://github.com/bsosnovski/Intro-Stats-Excel-Lab-Manual/blob/main/Data_Sets/Lab-11-Babies.xlsx. Open the Excel file Lab 11 Babies.xlsx and follow the instructions below. 11.2 Calculating the Mean and Standard Deviation First, you will make a copy of the data on birthweight and sort the values from the smallest to the largest. Then you will calculate the mean and standard deviation. These Excel functions were covered in Lab 4 Measures of Central Tendency and Variation. Select the cells in Column B (cells B1:B1001). Note: A shortcut to select data in a range, click on the first cell in the range and press the Shift + Arrow Down keys to select a range of data. Copy (CRTL-C on PC or Command-C on MAC) the selected data, click on cell J1 (or any empty cells of the worksheet), and Paste (CRTL-V on PC or Command-V on MAC) the data. Select the cells J1:J1001 (or the cells that contain the copy of the data). Go to Sort &amp; Filter ribbon in the Home tab and select Sort Smallest to Largest. Type the label Mean in cell H1. Select cell H2, then enter the formula = AVERAGE(J2:J101). Adjust the mean value to one (1) decimal place. Type the label Stand Dev in cell H3. Select cell H4, then enter = STDEV(J2:J101). Adjust the standard deviation value to two (2) decimal places. The data’s mean is 119.9, and the standard deviation is 17.99. 11.3 Graphing the Normal Distribution The NORM.DIST(x,mean,standard_dev,FALSE) function calculates the normal probability density function that can be used to plot the bell-shaped curve. To graph the normal curve, we need x and y values. The x values correspond to the birthweights. The y values are values of the probability density functions. First, you will generate the y-values and then use a scatter plot to display the bell-shaped curve. Select the cell K1 and type the label Y-Values. Below Y-Values, enter the formula = NORM.DIST(J2,$H$2,$H$4, FALSE). Select cell K2 and place the mouse pointer in the lower right corner of the selected cell until it becomes a + sign, and click-drag downward across the range that covers all the values in column K. The y-values range from \\(3.34\\) x \\(10^{-5}\\) to \\(1.71\\) x \\(10^{-4}\\). Select all cells in the birthweight and Y-Values columns (select the first cells in columns J and K, then press the Shift + Arrow Down keys to select the whole range of data). Click Insert &gt; Scatter &gt; Scatter with Smooth Lines. Figure 11.1: The normal curve created. The resulting graph needed to be adjusted (Figure 11.1 ). Use the instructions in Steps 3-8 in Section 9.2 Creating a Scatter Plot to make the necessary adjustments to the graph. Adjust the title, axis titles, and horizontal axis. 11.4 Calculating Probability or Cumulative Area We can use the NORM.DIST(x,mean,standard_dev,TRUE) function to calculate the probability that variable x falls below or at a specified value. Recall that a percentile in a normal distribution also corresponds to the area to the left (cumulative area) of a specific value. Select cell L1 and enter the label Percentile. Go to cell L2 and enter the formula = NORM.DIST(J2,$H$2,$H$4,TRUE). Note: Remember to include the $ symbol. Select cell L2 and place the mouse pointer in the lower right corner of the selected cell until it becomes a + sign, and click-drag downward across the range that covers all the values in column K. In the Home tab, select Percentage (%) in the Numbers ribbon to convert the values in Column L to percentages. Adjust the probability (or percentiles) values to two (2) decimal places. The data’s percentiles should range from 0.02% to 99.91%. 11.5 Finding Raw Scores from Probabilities The function NORM.INV(probability,mean,standard_dev), where probability is in the percentage form, will provide the raw value corresponding to the probability (or percentile). Select cell M1 and type the label 90th Percentile. In cell M2, type the label 95th Percentile. In cell M3, type the label 99th Percentile. In cell N1, type = NORM.INV(90%, $H$2,$H$4). Note: Remember to include the $ symbol. Repeat Step 4 above to obtain the other percentiles, 95th in cell N2 and 99th in cell N3. 11.6 Converting to Z-Scores We can use STANDARDIZE(value, mean, standard_dev) to convert any value to a z-score when the mean and standard deviation are given. Select the cell K1 and type the label Z-Scores. Below Z-Scores, enter the formula = STANDARDIZE(J2,$H$2,$H$4). Note: Remember to include the $ symbol. Select the cell with the z-score calculated, K2. Place the mouse pointer in the lower right corner of the selected cell until it becomes a + sign, and click-drag downward across the range that covers all the values in column J. Adjust the z-scores values to two (2) decimal places 11.7 Practice For the variable mother’s age, perform the following tasks. 1. Graph the normal curve for the distribution. 2. Find the distribution’s probability. 3. Find the 88th Percentile. 4. Find the z-scores. "],["the-central-limit-theorem.html", "Lab 12 The Central Limit Theorem 12.1 Preparation 12.2 Mean and Standard Deviation of the Population 12.3 Generating Random Samples 12.4 Sample Means 12.5 The Mean and Standard Deviation of the Sampling Distribution 12.6 Practice", " Lab 12 The Central Limit Theorem The sampling distribution of sample means is a distribution formed by means of all samples of size \\(n\\) repeatedly taken from a population. If a population has mean \\(\\mu\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\), and all possible samples of size \\(n\\) are taken from the population then sampling distribution satisfies the following properties \\(\\mu_{\\bar{x}}=\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma_{\\bar{x}}=\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}\\). The Central Limit Theorem states that the sampling distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size gets larger no matter the population distribution’s shape. This is especially true for sample sizes over 30. The greater the sample size, the better the approximation. If the population itself is normally distributed, then the sampling distribution of sample means is normally distributed for any sample size \\(n\\). In this lab, you will simulate the sampling distribution by generating some of the samples of a specific size and comparing the results with the theoretical values for actual sampling distribution. 12.1 Preparation You will use the Lab 12 FB Daily.xlsx that contains some of the daily Facebook stock prices. Download the data set from here https://github.com/bsosnovski/Intro-Stats-Excel-Lab-Manual/blob/main/Data_Sets/Lab-12-FB-Daily.xlsx. Open the Excel file Lab 12 FB Daily.xlsx and follow the instructions below. 12.2 Mean and Standard Deviation of the Population Assume that the data contains all the Close Prices of the FB stocks (it is data from a population). You will calculate the mean and standard deviation of the populations of FB Close Prices. Go to an empty column in the Lab 12 FB Daily worksheet, and type the label Population, Mean and Stand Dev in separate cells. Select the cell next to the cell Mean and enter the formula = AVERAGE(F2:F389) to compute the mean. Select the cell next to the cell Stand Dev and enter = STDEV.P(F2:F389) to compute the data’s standard deviation of the population. Adjust the mean and standard deviation values to two (2) decimal places. 12.3 Generating Random Samples You will simulate the sampling distribution by generating only 10 random samples of Close Prices with a sample size equal to 20. Go to an empty column and type the label Sample 1. Below Sample 1, click Data &gt; Data Analysis &gt; Sampling. Click OK. In the window that appears, enter the following: Input Range: Select cells F2:F389. Sample method: Check Random. Number of Samples: 20. Output Options: Click Output Range. Select below Sample 1 to paste the sample created.. Click OK. Repeat the process for Sample 2 through Sample 10. Figure 12.1: Sampling window in Data Analysis ribbon 12.4 Sample Means Now you will calculate the mean for each sample you generated. For each sample, place its sample mean below the column that contains the sample (use a similar formula to the one in Section 12.2 Mean and Standard Deviation of the Population). Highlight the results to distinguish them from the values in the sample. Figure 12.2: An example of the sampling mean distribution generated. 12.5 The Mean and Standard Deviation of the Sampling Distribution After Section 12.4 above, all the ten (10) sample means should be on the same row (Figure 12.2). From these sample means calculate the mean and standard deviation (use STDEV.S) for the FB Close Prices in an empty part of the worksheet. Calculate the population standard deviation value in Section 12.2 divided by \\(\\sqrt{20}\\) (square root of the sample size). Recall that the theoretical value of generating all the samples of size 20 should be \\(\\mu_{\\bar{x}}=\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma_{\\bar{x}}=\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}\\). Compare the results in Step 1 with the results obtained in Step 2. 12.6 Practice Repeat the process above with 10 samples of size 50 for the FB Close Prices. Repeat the process above with 20 samples of size 50 for the FB Open Prices. "]]
